ï¼Šfrom the single Isobel

You've got yourself in a fine mess there Charlene
You're either absolutely mad or you are joking Charlene

Charlene I'm crying so close to you darling
Were naked and laughing
You shine on my battery Charlene
(Charlene, Charlene, Charlene, Charlene)

I have always adored your witty mouth Charlene
Now would you please be very, very rude to them Charlene

Charlene I'm crying so close to you darling
Were naked and laughing
You shine on my battery Charlene

Let me get you out of that lady Charlene
Your dress is red and oh so slippery Charlene

I guess I have to dry you
Dress you and comb you
You're already late
I'll sort you out

Charlene I'm crying so close to you darling
Were naked and laughing
You shine on my battery Charlene
(Charlene, Charlene, Charlene, Charlene)
