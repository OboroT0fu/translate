In a woman's lifetime
She gets four hundred eggs
But only two or three nests
Woven with a mother's life force (Woven with a mother's life force)
Emotional textile (Woven with a mother's life force, woven with a mother's life force)

Nihilist happеning cuts through this
Nihilist happening
You did well, you, you did your best

You did, did, di-di-di-di-di-di well
You di-di-di-di-did well
You did well
