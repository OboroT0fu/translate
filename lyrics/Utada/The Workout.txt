ï¼Šfrom the album Exodus

I was dancing with a dirty blond texan
Charming accent but the music's playing too loud for talking
So I showed him 
How people in the far east get down

Push it up, push it down
Pull it up, pull it down
Keep it up, keep it down
Now put me down
What a workout!

If you want, you can come
Come get it, get it
If you don't, you may really regret it, 'gret it
Up and down till your knees start shakin', shakin'
Ain't it good to be alive tonight

One life, two-time, three girls, four guys
Five ripples running up and down my spine
6.0 make it sweet, drop another dime

I was talking with a born-again christian
Ah-ah, ah-uh
"So what's it like to start life all over?"
He sad "amen, I feel like I've been rediscovering the tomb of tutankhamen"

Push it up, push it down
Pull it up, pull it down
Baby, don't put me down
What a workout!

What you want, it's a done deal, shake it, shake it
What you don't, you can forget about it, 'bout it
Up and down, feel your brainwaves jumpin' jumpin'
Makes me want to take a dive, oh-oh, yeah

Oh-oh, as we count to five

One life, two-time, three girls, four guys
Five ripples running up and down my spine
Can you hold on, someone's calling on the other line

I'm back
Push it up, push it down
Pull it up, pull it down
Keep it up, keep it down
Now put me down
What a workout!

If you want, you can come, come get it, get it
If you don't you may really regret it, 'gret it
Up and down till your knees start shakin', shakin'
Ain't it good to be alive tonight

One life, two-time, three girls, four guys
Five ripples running up and down my spine
6.0 make it sweet, drop another dime
