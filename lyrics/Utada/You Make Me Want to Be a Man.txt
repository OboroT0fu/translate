＊from the album Exodus

I really wanna tell you something
 - 本当に君に何かを伝えたい
This is just the way I am
 - これが私で居る方法
I really wanna tell you something, but I can't
 - 本当に君に何かを伝えたい でも出来ない
You make me want to be a man
 - 君は私を男になりたいと思わせる
Arguments that have no meaning
 - 意味の無い口論
This is just the way I am
 - これが私で居る方法
You really wanna tell me something, but you can't
 - 君は本当に何かを伝えたい でも出来ない
You make me want to be a man
 - 君は私を男になりたいと思わせる

The thunder and the rain
 - 雷と雨が
Called you and you came
 - 君を呼び 君はやって来る
We didn't need to say much to communicate
 - 私たちは少ない言葉でも意思疎通が出来た
Now it's different
 - 今は違う
99% is misinterpreted
 - 99%が誤解される

I really wanna tell you something
 - 本当に君に何かを伝えたい
This is just the way I am
 - これが私で居る方法
I really wanna tell you something, but I can't

Every word you say, finds a home in me
 - 君の言う全ての言葉で 私の中に家を見つけられる
Nothing that anyone could ever say
Could hurt me like this
 - 今まで誰かが放った言葉でこんな風に私を傷つけるものは無かった
Baby please, don't light that cigarette
 - ねえお願い 煙草に火を付けないで
Don't light that cigarette
 - 煙草に火をつけないで
