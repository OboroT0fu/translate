＊from the album Deep River

When you walk away
 - 貴方が立ち去る時
You don't hear me say please
 - 貴方は私が言うのを聞かない
Oh baby, don't go
 - ねえ愛しい人 いかないで
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
 - 簡単でまっさらな感情を貴方は私に今夜感じさせる
It's hard to let it go
 - 振り切るのは難しい

You're giving me too many things lately
 - 最近貴方は私に多くのものを与えてくれる
You're all I need
 - 貴方は私の必要な全て
You smiled at me, and said
 - 貴方は私に笑いかけ そして言った

Don't get me wrong I love you
 - 勘違いしないで 僕は君を愛してる
But does that mean I have to meet your father?
 - でもそれは君のお父さんと会わなきゃいけないってこと？
When we are older you'll understand
What I meant when I said "No,
 - 僕らが歳を重ねれば君もその意味が分かる筈 そして私は
I don't think life is quite that simple"
  - 違う 私はそんなに人生が簡単だとは思わない

When you walk away
You don't hear me say please
Oh baby, don't go
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

The daily things that keep us all busy
 - 私達を忙しくさせる日々の出来事は
Are confusing me
 - 私を惑わせ
That's when you came to me and said
 - 貴方が来てくれた時私は言った

Wish I could prove I love you
 - 僕が君を愛してるのは証明できればいいのに
But does that mean I have to walk on water?
 - でもそれは僕が水の上を歩かなきゃならないこと？
When we are older you'll understand
 - 歳をとったら君も分かるよ
It's enough when I say so
 - 僕が言うには十分だし
And maybe some things are that simple
 - いくつかのことは簡単に出来てるんだ

When you walk away
You don't hear me say please
Oh baby, don't go
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

Hold me
 - 抱きしめて
Whatever lies beyond this morning
 - 今朝にどんなものが潜んでいたとしても
Is a little later on
 - それは少し後のこと
Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all
 - 危険を気にせず 未来は私を一切恐れさせない
Nothing's like before
 - 何もかもが今までとは違っている
